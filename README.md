# food_image_classification

Image classification model and analysis built on Food11 Kaggle Dataset.

Analysis includes: dataset snapshots, baseline TensorFlow model, model evaluation (prediction analysis, classification reprot, confusion matrix etc.), Feature Extraction and Fine Tuning using EfficientNet.

Confusion Matrixes not showing on GitHub or Kaggle.. not sure why but not too concerned. Kaggle notebook: [My Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mattneel/food-image-classification/)
